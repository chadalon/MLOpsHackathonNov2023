Interviewer: Hey there! Uh, thanks for, you know, coming in today. We've, um, already looked at your technical skills through your portfolio and coding tests and all that. But, uh, today, I'd like to, you know, dive a bit into understanding your soft skills. Does that sound okay?
Candidate: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I've always believed that, you know, soft skills are, well, just as crucial in a development role. So, yeah, I'm totally up for discussing them.
Interviewer: Great, great. So, um, let's start with, uh, teamwork. Can you maybe describe a time when you, uh, had a disagreement with a team member and, you know, how you went about resolving it?
Candidate: Oh, sure. So, at my previous job, there was this one time when a colleague and I, well, we didn't exactly see eye to eye on the architecture for a project. Instead of, you know, letting it become this big issue, we thought, "Why not have a meeting?" We, um, discussed our perspectives, and, uh, then we brainstormed a bit. In the end, we came up with a solution that, well, took a bit from both our ideas. It was, I guess, a win-win, and the project really benefited from our, you know, collaboration.
Interviewer: Ah, that sounds, um, really constructive. So, how do you, you know, handle feedback? Especially when it's, well, not all that positive?
Candidate: Well, I've always seen feedback as, um, a chance to grow, you know? It's not always easy to hear, of course, but I try to, you know, separate my feelings from the feedback and focus on the, um, content. If something's not clear, I'll, you know, ask for more details. The main thing is, I want to learn from it and, well, get better.
Interviewer: Mhm, that's a, uh, good way to look at it. Now, when everything seems, you know, super urgent, how do you, um, prioritize tasks?
Candidate: Oh, that's a good one. I usually start by, you know, listing out all the tasks. Then I, um, categorize them based on, well, their impact and how urgent they are. If there are things that depend on each other, I'll factor those in too. And, um, communication is super important, so I'll often check in with, you know, stakeholders or my team to make sure I'm on the right track.
Interviewer: Got it, got it. And, um, lastly, when you're faced with, you know, a technology or concept you're not familiar with, but it's, like, super important for a project, how do you handle that?
Candidate: Oh, I love those challenges! I mean, I see them as, well, opportunities rather than problems. I'll start by doing some research, maybe take an online course, or, you know, ask colleagues who might know more about it. I really believe in, um, leveraging the collective knowledge of the team. It's, you know, all about learning and growing.
Interviewer: That's a, uh, great mindset to have. Thanks for, you know, sharing all that.
